Plan_Risk_Management,4.1,Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Management Process,"The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy
Management with all other project management activities.
Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan. This plan describes how the
processes. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project
management, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest benefit,
initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the
corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk.
management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders
become clearer or change.
Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management
plan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the specific risk management activities should be
established in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures
budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated,
allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will define the monitoring methods to ensure that the
budget for risk management can be modified.
In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management
activities need to be repeated throughout the project. The risk management plan should define both the.
normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as specific or exceptional conditions under which the
corresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated
into the project management plan.
There are two categories of success criteria for risk management: those for success of the project in
general, and those for success of Project Risk Management.

CHAPTER 4  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
Project-Related Criteria. To assess the success of Project Risk Management, the stakeholders
must agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and
scope). In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management
plan should present these objectives with reference to the project definition documents. To provide
guidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also
prioritize each project objective.
Process-Related Criteria. The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a
number of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project
Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than
for a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process
may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be
allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project..
The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant
stakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be influenced by a number
of factors, all of which need to be identified. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the
should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the
Project Risk Management processes in the specific project.
Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should
reflect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders. The project manager should
maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware ol
any changes in the stakeholders attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts
into account.
It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks,
and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be defined in a
manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis
uses such terms as ""high impact or ""medium probability,"" these should be defined objectively in the risk
management plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required ir
quantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control.
Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a
template of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan
should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management
processes should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the specified risk
management objectives.
In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project
team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria
for determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond
this level. The risk management plan specifies the project's risk management roles and responsibilities and
defines the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel.

CHAPTER 4  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project
team and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are
defined in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various
processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the
plan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received
as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the
information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly defined.",the objectives of the plan risk management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy

may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this. Alternatively it may use a proprietary or
pre-existing approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational
process assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities: standard
risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is
required, and a definition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant

Whichever risk identification techniques are used, it is important that identified risks are unambiguously
described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or
diluted by non-risks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk meta-language offers a useful
way of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in
risk, and effect is shown in Figure 5-2.

Perform_Qualitative_Risk_Analysis,6.1,Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Qualitative Risk,"Analysis Process
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually
identified project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics.
Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur
and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall
risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with
each other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter 7).
One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise.
from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus
on addressing this root cause.
Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identification of the areas of greatest risk exposure
(e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable's scope), facilitating risk response
focus in these areas.
The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify
Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most influence
threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk
discussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.",analysis process the perform qualitative risk analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually identified project risks

Manageability. Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to
address them. The project team may examine these and decide to:
oGo forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve.
oStop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an

Perform_Quantitative_Risk_Analysis,7.1,Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Quantitative Risk,"Analysis Process
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overalleffect of risk on
the objectives of the project, based on current plans and information, when considering risks simultaneously..
Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project
objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks
and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders.
It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as
Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule
than a non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are.
deterministic. However itshould be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is notalways required or appropriate
effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process,
the benefits of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the
additional insights and value justify the additional effort.
Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time.
and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously.
Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.
Specific project risks are usually best understood and quantified at a detailed level such as the line-item
cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project's budget or
the schedule are specified at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such
as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantified risks on project objectives..
The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires:
Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project
Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a
Ievel of detail that lends itself to specific assessment of individual risks..
Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements.
Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates
multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.

CHAPTER 7  PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISKANALYSIS
Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan (baseline or current) to give
management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as:.
What is the probability of meeting the project's objectives?
How much contingency reserve (e.g., reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost) is needed to
provide the organization with the level of certainty it reguires based upon its risk tolerance?
What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute
the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously?
Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk?
Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantified
risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are
within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk
responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.

Plan_Risk_Responses,8.1,Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process,"The obiective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the
chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints.
Once risks have been identified, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every
risk the project team considers to be sufficiently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project
objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the
potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause.
Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response
specification for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions.
be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process,
owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses
if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are
assigned to a single person.
Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can
generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the
same way as those risks which were initially identified.
It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit
to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain
documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.

CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES
All the approved, unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the
project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The
corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked, including the following:.

Project planning, budgeting, and scheduling;
Resource management; and

Monitor_and_Control_Risks,9.1,Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process,"The primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identified risks, monitor residual risks,
identify new risks, ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time, and evaluate their
effectiveness throughout the project life cycle.
In addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions, the effectiveness of all of the Project
Risk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current
project as well as future ones.
For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been defined, the corresponding set of
trigger conditions should have been specified. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these
conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as defined, in a timely
manner.
Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions
should have been included and defined in the current project management plan. The first action of risk
monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary,
that the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework.
The risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their
responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so
that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of specific risks,
a timely manner.
In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness
owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been
effectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented.

CHAPTER 9  MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS
As the project progresses, additional information becomes available and the project environment may
change as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant.
The planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk
reassessment, including risk identification, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals,
risk reassessment are:
Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk,.
Need to analyze a complex change request,
 Phase end review,
Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and.
Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current.
In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to
reassessing the risks.
In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and
weaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or
the current or future projects.
At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out
Ievel of detail, etc.
At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure o1
occurred and impact to the project scope (i.e., time, cost, and quality).
The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with specific information
with respect to the project's experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization
should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the
corresponding organizational process assets.
An overview of the steps involved in the Monitor and Control Risks process is given in Figure 9-1.
